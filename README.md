## Gitignore Creator

### Problem

When using particular programming languages, some will create temporary files,
or compiled files that should not be committed into a repository.


### Solution

Github has compiled a collection of gitignore files.
I have created this to list the current languages supported by those files,
Then give the ability to download to the current directory a particular file.
